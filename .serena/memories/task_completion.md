# Task completion checklist

No test framework, linter or formatter exists. Verify with:

1. gcc build with `-std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic` plus the required flags: no warnings. Also the clang build (see `mem:suggested_commands`).
2. `clang --analyze -std=c99 branch_bench.c`: no warnings.
3. `./branch_bench` exits 0, all four tests run, and Test 4 prints no "results differ" warning. Shuffled/random variants should be clearly slower than sorted/periodic in Tests 1, 2 and 4-branch.
4. Output: the default run's console and `-o` report keep their format (compare with the previous build, numbers masked). New features must only change output when their option is used.
5. Kernels: compare the disassembly with the previous build (instructions, ignoring addresses and padding nops); real conditional branches must remain (no cmov or SIMD) and no loop may be eliminated. Check that no hot-loop jump crosses or ends on a 32-byte boundary (JCC erratum on Skylake-derived Intel). If kernel code changed, compare cycles per element and cost per miss against the previous build (`-n 5`).
6. Option changes: test invalid and missing values (exit code 1, clear message) and `--help`.
7. Non-perf path: code must still compile without `HAVE_PERF` (e.g. `-U__linux__` on a scratch copy) and handle missing individual counters.
8. Keep `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` and these memories in sync with behaviour changes.

Don't commit unless the user asks.
